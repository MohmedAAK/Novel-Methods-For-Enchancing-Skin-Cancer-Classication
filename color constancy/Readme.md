#Notes

In this file we try color constancy as we say in our project document
But wasn't selected as main light effect and streatch but it doesn't show promising results

Our main light effect was augmentation random light (max=0.5) by fastai api

This code has been used once so it is not optimized as you will see

Feel free to try your own ideas , we just did simple tests with fastai in few epoches so we don't know long term training effect due our limited season time of colab
